This is my continuation of a previous project involving Reddit's API to create a pseudo-reddit web app. I particularily was fascinated by this project as it was a good method to try fetch requests and to develop an understanding of the Redux toolkit. 
This project is designed to browse Reddit through a searchbar, to view stories and to take you directly to Reddit to see the original post that was made. The data brought back is formatted to show the titles, users, and the content.

I began to continue to develop my 'minimal' version of reddit to gain a better understanding on web design, layout, working with asynchronous callbacks, and to correctly render data for a user. I found this to have excellent potential to show these skills as well  as to entertain the user who happens to visit.
Happy coding!
